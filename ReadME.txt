This Project requires some specific requirements
1. Tensorflow 2.0
2. GPU support 
The dataset which consist of 
1.Petal Length
2. Petal Width
3. Sepal Length
4. Sepal Width
5. The type of Species the flower  
This dataset is taken from Kaggle.com
In the Dataset there are 3 types of Species
1.Setosa
2.Versicolor
3.Virginica

The Project consits of Different Phases
